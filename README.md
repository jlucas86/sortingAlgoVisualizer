    - selection sort
    - radix sort
    - bucket sort
- detailed desciption of how each algorithm works
- allow user to pause and play comparison
- allow user to run step by step
- allow user to select the orientation of the visualization graph
- allow user to view the arrays in number format insted of just on a graph
- allow user to sort random data of a selected size
- allow user to input data to be sorted
    - from file (must be a csv)
    - from mamual input
